# Why use Java Chassis

- **High performance**

  The transport capability of Java Chassis is based on [Vert.x](https://vertx.io), which enables Java Chassis to process
  massive requests with relatively less hardware resources, and support [reactive develop style](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org).

- **Native support for OpenAPI**

  Java Chassis describes the APIs of the microservices via [Swagger](https://swagger.io) natively, to help
  developers to design microservices that comply to [OpenAPI standard](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/).

- **Flexible develop style**

  Currently Java Chassis allow developers to develop their microservice APIs in `SpringMVC`/`JAX-RS`/`transparent RPC` styles,
  and to send the request in `RPC`/`RestTemplate` styles. And there are three kind of build-in transport mode:
  `Rest over Vertx`/`Rest over Servlet`/`Highway`. All of these features can be combined and replaced easily,
  because they are decoupled and all based on the Swagger schema, which can provide high flexibility.

- **Out-of-box microservice governance features**

  Java Chassis provides a lot of features for microservice governance and monitor.

# Quick Start

Provider service:
```java
import org.apache.servicecomb.*;
@RpcSchema(schemaId = "helloworld")
public class HelloWorldProvider implements HelloWorld {
    public String sayHello(String name) {
        return "Hello " + name;
    }
}
```

Consumer service:
```java
import org.apache.servicecomb.*;
@Component
public class HelloWorldConsumer  {
	@RpcReference(microserviceName = "pojo", schemaId = "helloworld")
	private static HelloWorld helloWorld;

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		helloWorld.sayHello("Tank");
	}
}
```

# Documentation

Project documentation is available on the [ServiceComb Java Chassis Developer Guide][java-chassis-developer-guide].

[java-chassis-developer-guide]: https://servicecomb.apache.org/references/java-chassis/en_US/

# Building

You don’t need to build from source to use Java Chassis (binaries in apache nexus ), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Java Chassis can be easily built with the maven.  You also need JDK 1.8.

      mvn clean install

The first build may take a longer than expected as Maven downloads all the dependencies.

# Automated Testing

  To build the docker image and run the integration tests with docker, you can use maven docker profile

      mvn clean install -Pdocker -Pit  -Pdemo-run-release

  If you are using docker machine, please use the following command

      mvn clean install -Pdocker -Pit -Pdocker-machine -Pdemo-run-release
