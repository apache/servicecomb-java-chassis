/**
 * <pre>
 *  Filters are the basics of how an invocation is executed.
 *
 * thread rule:
 *   assume a provider filter chains is: f1, f2, schedule, f3, f4
 *
 *   schedule is a builtIn filter, which will dispatch invocations to operation related threadPool
 *
 *   f1 and f2 are before "schedule" filter, default to run in eventLoop
 *   if developers customize filters and switch to other threads
 *   it's better to switch back to eventLoop, unless you know what you are doing
 *
 *   f3 and f4 are after "schedule" filter, default thread depend on controller's method signature
 *     1. if controller method not return CompletableFuture
 *        then will run in a real threadPool
 *     2. if controller method return CompletableFuture
 *        then will still run in eventLoop
 *   so filters after "schedule" filter, are more complex than filters before "schedule"
 *   if developers need to do some BLOCK logic, MUST use different Strategy when running in different thread:
 *     1. threadPool: run do BLOCK logic directly
 *     2. eventLoop: MUST submit to a threadPool, and then switch back
 *        (<a href="https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#golden_rule">reactive golden rule</a>)
